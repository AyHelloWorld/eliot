# Eliot: Logging that tells you _why_ it happened

---

# Why do we want logs?
# To know:

## 1. **What** happened.

## 2. **Why** it happened.

---

# Traditional logging tells us what happened

```
2018-08-22T17:23:45 INFO Outside in the cold distance
2018-08-22T17:23:46 WARN A wildcat did growl
2018-08-22T17:23:47 INFO Two riders were approaching
2018-08-22T17:23:48 INFO The wind began to howl
```

---

# But it doesn't tell us _why_ it happened

## Did the wildcat growl because of the cold or the riders?
## Were the riders in the cold distance, or merely outside?
## How was the wind related to any of this?

---

# Eliot gives you causality

# Eliot tells us _why_ it happened

## Semantic model is tree of actions

```
└── outside
    ├── approach
    │   └── growl
    └── wind:howl
```

---

# Here's the code

```python
with start_action(action_type="outside",
                  weather="cold",
                  location="distance"):
    with start_action(action_type="approach",
                      who=[rider1, rider2]):
        with start_action(action_type="growl",
                          who=[wildcat]):
            # ...
    Message.log(message_type="wind:howl")
```

---

# Output format is still linear

## De-facto standard of JSON message per line
## Much easier to parse than text

---

# Use cases

## **Scientific computing (reproducability, debuggability)**
## Distributed systems
## Anything hard to understand

---

# Integrations

## asyncio coroutines
## Twisted
## Logstash → ElasticSearch
## journald
## Dask (work in progress)
